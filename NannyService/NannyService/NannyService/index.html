                      <p>Hi! My name is Zana, I’m a full-time nanny caring for children in Marin County for two decades. I started with 3 children of my own, who are all adults now! Prior to that, I worked as a child psychologist in my home country, and in the 90’s assisted in establishing multiple women’s and children’s centers all over Croatia. My decades of experience in both child care and child psychology have enabled me to give the best care possible to children, and give new parents advice on how to raise their children when they are unsure. What makes me unique from other nannies is I truly establish a bond with the children and families I care for as I am with them for years on a daily basis. I generally work for families long term, an average of 3-5 years, in some cases longer; and as result become almost part of the family, often staying in contact even after my services are no longer needed.</p>
